# terminal_timer
Simple terminal timer that I made using Rust so as to be able to see how much time I spend coding.

Functionalites:
- save data to .timer_date csv file in home directory

- -s or start or --start to start timer
- -t or today or --td for today's data
- -x or --lx for last x days data (including today)
  add -s or --sum to sum all work and play time during these last days
