# terminal_timer
Simple terminal timer that I made using Rust so as to be able to see how much time I spend coding.

Basic functionalities:
- when you run executable timer starts by default, you can also start timer with argument start or -s
- argument times or -t lists all the times recorded add a number to get the n latest

Would be nice to implement:
- weekly/monthl/yearly hours
- what times you work the most
